# AutoClicker

AutoClicker is a Python application that allows you to automate mouse clicks on a specific position on your screen. The application also features a GUI that allows you to adjust the clicking interval, save the current cursor position, and pause/resume the clicking process.

## Requirements

4. Press the "Stop" button or press the "R" key again to stop the auto-clicking process
5. Press the "M" key or click the "Move to saved position" button to move the cursor to the saved position
6. The "Clicks" label shows the number of clicks performed so far
